# Implementation status and handoff log

This file is the resumable implementation ledger. The approved design and plan remain authoritative; this records what the code actually implements and why.

## Current state

- Branch: `feat/subsyncd`
- Current task: Task 6, OpenSubtitles adapter
- Next task: Task 7, Titlovi adapter
- Runtime module: `subsyncd` on Go 1.27
- Test caches: `GOCACHE=/tmp/subsyncd-gocache`, `GOMODCACHE=/tmp/subsyncd-gomodcache`

## Completed tasks

### Task 1 — domain and configuration

- Commit: `679035f feat: bootstrap subsyncd domain and configuration`
- Implemented canonical BCP 47 languages with explicit legacy aliases, strict single-document YAML, whole-scalar environment expansion, provider/language routing validation, path/root checks, and the approved example configuration.
- Added the pinned Bazarr behavior/decision index. Bazarr remains reference-only GPL-3.0 material.
- Verified with configuration/domain tests and `go vet ./...`.

### Task 2 — SQLite and schedules

- Commit: `6924360 feat: add persistent scheduling and provenance store`
- Implemented transactional embedded migrations, WAL/foreign-key/busy-timeout SQLite setup, typed media/inventory/search/provider/pack/installation persistence, recoverable leases, deterministic missing/failure/upgrade schedules, and an injected test clock.
- Important behavior: provider state is keyed by provider instance plus operation scope; pack eviction returns expired entries before live LRU entries; installation audit and provenance commit atomically.
- Verified with race-enabled `internal/store`, `internal/schedule`, and `internal/testutil` tests plus `go vet ./...`.

### Task 3 — Arr catalogs, webhooks, and path mapping

- Commit: `b047df2 feat: integrate Sonarr and Radarr catalogs`

- Webhook IDs are stable hashes of configured instance, normalized Arr event name, media kind, and Arr file ID. Duplicate deliveries are database no-ops.
- Imports and renames hydrate the authoritative file/episode-or-movie/series records from Arr before persistence. Deletes do not require a now-missing remote file resource.
- Content provenance invalidation compares Arr file ID, byte size, and nanosecond timestamp. A path-only rename retains candidate provenance while updating the path.
- Import/upgrade resets the missing schedule for every configured language. Delete events release/cancel pending jobs and remain in a bounded 10,000-row audit log.
- Reconciliation applies the full hydrated history page and cursor in one SQLite transaction, preventing a cursor gap after a partial failure.
- Path mapping tightens Bazarr behavior: longest boundary-aware remote prefix wins, both slash styles are accepted, case is preserved, traversal is rejected, and existing parent symlinks are resolved before media-root containment is accepted.
- Arr errors include instance/status and at most 4 KiB of response text; API keys are never included. Default client timeout is 15 seconds.
- Ordinary tests use sanitized fixture JSON and loopback fake servers only.
- Verification: `go test ./... -race`, `go vet ./...`, and `git diff --check` passed. The full run exposed and retained a regression for SQLite partial unique indexes; targetless `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is required for the partial `events(event_id)` index.

## Known follow-ups

- The application wiring will create/ensure configured Arr instance rows before reconciliation starts.
- HTTP webhook token validation belongs to the HTTP API task; catalog normalization deliberately accepts bytes only after transport authentication.
- Reconciliation currently hydrates history rows that still identify a live file. Deletions are handled by delete webhooks; if an Arr history endpoint exposes reliable deletion tombstones, add them behind a contract fixture before changing this rule.

### Task 4 — embedded and sidecar inventory

- Commit: `0f69f8d feat: cache embedded subtitle inventory`

- FFprobe is invoked through an injectable runner with the exact approved arguments. JSON stdout is bounded to 8 MiB; failure text does not expose captured stderr.
- Every subtitle stream is inventoried, including image codecs such as PGS. Unknown/missing languages remain visible with an empty canonical language but never satisfy a configured language.
- `Inventory.Satisfies` requires an equivalent known language and a full subtitle. Forced-only tracks never satisfy the normal-language request; SDH satisfies only when hearing-impaired subtitles are allowed.
- The cached embedded inventory is reused only when path, Arr file ID, byte size, and nanosecond modification time match. `forceProbe` always bypasses the cache.
- Sidecars are rescanned on every refresh, only for the exact media stem and `.srt`, `.ass`, `.ssa`, or `.vtt`; directory recursion and symlink following are forbidden.
- An external file is considered managed only when both normalized path and SHA-256 checksum match installation provenance. All other external tracks are protected.
- Fingerprint update and complete track replacement occur in one SQLite transaction so a crash cannot pair a new fingerprint with stale embedded rows.
- Verification: `go test ./... -race`, `go vet ./...`, and `git diff --check` passed.

### Task 5 — provider registry, coordinator, and throttling

- Commit: `6cf5c97 feat: add provider registry and persistent throttling`

- Providers are compiled-in factories producing independently credentialed named instances. The registry validates duplicate IDs, unknown types, provider-specific strict YAML, and language capabilities before workers start.
- Exact-hash-capable providers run sequentially in configured order; the first exact result stops all further searches. If none succeeds, all providers assigned to that language receive one concurrent broad query. Results merge in configured order and failures remain provider-local.
- Normalized search results cache for six hours by provider instance, search mode, media/file fingerprint, language, episode identity, and release name. HTTP(S) download URLs are stripped before persistence; opaque provider IDs may be retained.
- Each provider instance owns a token bucket and active-request semaphore. A separate host-origin semaphore coordinates multiple accounts/types using the same upstream origin.
- Cooldowns and quotas persist by provider instance plus `all`, `search`, `download`, or `auth` scope. An exhausted future window prevents the HTTP call and returns a typed reset immediately; workers never sleep through remote cooldowns.
- Parsed response evidence includes named `RateLimit`/`RateLimit-Policy` windows, `X-RateLimit-*`, seconds/date `Retry-After`, and provider JSON resets. Past/skewed resets are ignored and the most restrictive future reset wins.
- No-header fallbacks are Titlovi rate limit 5 minutes; OpenSubtitles rate limit 1 minute and download quota 6 hours; SubDL rate limit 15 minutes, daily quota until next GMT midnight plus 15 minutes, and service busy 1 hour.
- Added `golang.org/x/time/rate` v0.15.0 for local token-bucket pacing.
- Verification: `go test ./... -race`, `go vet ./...`, and `git diff --check` passed.
